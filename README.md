# 🎓 Academic-AI-Projects-UFMS

This repository contains two Artificial Intelligence projects developed during my undergraduate studies at **Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS)** as part of an **Artificial Intelligence course**.

The projects focus on applying core AI and Machine Learning concepts to practical problems, covering both **computer vision** and **natural language processing (NLP)** tasks. All implementations were developed in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. They represent academic exercises rather than production-grade systems, but they showcase foundational skills in AI and ML.

### 1. Fruit Recognition System (Computer Vision)

This project implements an image-based fruit recognition system using supervised learning techniques. The goal is to classify images of fruits based on visual features extracted from the images. The dataset is composed of labeled fruit images. Focus on understanding the end-to-end training pipeline rather than performance tuning.

**Main concepts explored:**
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  
- Feature extraction from images  
- Supervised classification  
- Model evaluation and accuracy analysis  

**Key learning outcomes:**
- Understanding the full image classification pipeline  
- Applying machine learning algorithms to visual data  
- Evaluating model performance on classification tasks

### 2. Text Classification System (Natural Language Processing)

This project focuses on building a text classification model using basic NLP techniques. The objective is to preprocess textual data and train a classifier capable of assigning texts to predefined categories.

**Main concepts explored:**
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning, normalization)  
- Feature representation (e.g., Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF)  
- Supervised learning for text data  
- Model training and evaluation  

**Key learning outcomes:**
- Understanding NLP preprocessing pipelines  
- Converting unstructured text into numerical features  
- Applying machine learning models to textual data
